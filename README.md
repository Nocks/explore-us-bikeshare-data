# Explore US Bikeshare Data
This is my 2nd Project of the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program from Udacity.

In this project, I wrote Python code to import US bike share data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
