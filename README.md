# Explore US Bikeshare Data
This is my 2nd Project of the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program from Udacity.

In this project, I wrote Python code to import US bike share data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


## Statistics Computed
I learned about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, wrote code to provide the following information:

### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

### 2 Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### 3 Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time

### 4 User info
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### 5 Display raw data to the user
- Display raw data to the user, upon their request.
- Ask if user wants to see more, and display the next 5 rows.
- Keep doing the above till user says no.
